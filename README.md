# NLP Sentence Type Finder

This project provides a Python-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that classifies sentences into four categories: **Declarative**, **Interrogative**, **Imperative**, and **Exclamatory**. It leverages rule-based methods, punctuation analysis, and basic syntactic patterns to determine the type of a given sentence.

## Features
- Classifies sentences into four types:
  - **Declarative**: A statement or fact.
  - **Interrogative**: A question.
  - **Imperative**: A command or request.
  - **Exclamatory**: An exclamation expressing strong emotion.
- Built with Python using **spaCy** and **NLTK**.
- Easy to integrate into other NLP-based applications such as chatbots and sentiment analysis tools.
